			<p>April is a multitasking monkey wench (not a typo!), doing both graphics and front-end coding. Her designs are unique and unusual, helping to make our clients stand out in the crowd.</p>

				<summary>In her own words:</summary>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I am married to my high school sweetheart. We've known each other since we were about 13. He was the high school valedictorian and I had a blue Mohawk. It truly was an "opposites attract" type of thing.</p>
					<p>I have been dying my hair purple for about 10 years now. I'm addicted to getting tattoos but all can be covered. (I still clean up nicely). I quit smoking after 20 years and have since taken up jogging and as of writing this; I can jog 3 miles without stopping. The after effects of that has   been a loss of 35 pounds and counting.</p>
					<p>We have ferrets. Right now, I only have 1 but there have been up to 12 rescues in our house at one time. We also have 2 cats.</p>
					<p>Finally, I am a super organized neat freak. (Hey...I think you have a speck on your shirt. Right there. Just above the logo on the left. Yeah. You looked didn't you?)</p>

				<summary>In his own words:</summary>
				<blockquote>
					<p>I was born at a very young age. It was a difficult transition, going from a warm and comfortable place into a bright, cold, inhospitible world, where immediatly I was assulted and molested by a figure of authority. Say what you like about doctors, anyone who would slap a new born babe is not a nice person in my book.</p>
					<p>It's no great surprise that I started talking to computers. They are so much more reasonible and rational than humans. Give them a list of directions and they will carry it out to the letter. Just try doing that with a human.</p>
